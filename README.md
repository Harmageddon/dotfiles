# rcfiles
A small collection of my personal configuration files.

## Including
If you want to use one of the configuration files in addition to your own files, you can easily include it. Just add the matching line in your own file:

### .bashrc, .bash_aliases and .vimrc
```
source /path/to/another/.bash_aliases
```

### .gitconfig
```
[include]
  path = /path/to/another/.gitconfig
```
